## Description

This is a blog website that I created using Node.js, Express, EJS, MongoDB and other dependencies. I built this project to practice my web development skills and to learn how to use a database to store and retrieve data. The website allows users to create, read, update and delete blog posts using a simple and intuitive interface.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your computer. Then follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the zip file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
4. Run `node app.js` to start the server.
5. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the website.
