## Description

This is a blog website that I created using Node.js, Express, EJS, MongoDB and other dependencies. I built this project to practice my web development skills and to learn how to use a database to store and retrieve data. The website allows users to create, read, update and delete blog posts using a simple and intuitive interface.
